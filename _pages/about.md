Hi! I am Vahideh Alizadeh, a computational chemist by education. This is my personal webpage that I would like to share different topics within such as computational chemistry, data science or even the books that i read and found them interesting. The website is build based on the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com)
